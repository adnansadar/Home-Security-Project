# Home-Security-Project
  This project was done in my First Year Second Semester.

## Overview
This is a home security system which uses Raspberry Pi 3, PIR sensor is used to detect the presence of an intruder using 
passive infrared rays. This triggers the Pi Camera which is also connected to the RPi. The Pi camera captures the image
and stores it in the firebase. You will receive an email containing pics of the intruder and also an alert on the Home Security
app which we created. You just need to install this on the front door of your house and you're all set!
